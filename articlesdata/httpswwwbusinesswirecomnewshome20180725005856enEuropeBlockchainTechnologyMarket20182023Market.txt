Key Growth Factors
Retail customers are now preferring digital platforms for making          purchase/payments. In order to provide continuous support, retailers          are looking to adopt Blockchain technology for securing and          streamlining processes. This would further accelerate the adoption of          Blockchain by retailers.
GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is expected to promote          Blockchain technology to overcome barriers and ease cross-border          payment.
Threats and Key Players
The decentralized characteristic of Blockchain technology clashes with          European regulations on personal data protection. This hinders the          adoption of the technology.
The key players in this region are Microsoft, IBM, Accenture,          Deloitte, and Capgemini.
